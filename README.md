# Minerva_RAM_Test
Revision of the RAM Test Utility for QL to detect faulty RAM ICs.

The changes are in the GUI (php and form) in order to point to the wrong IC place on the main board adding also QLs with internal replacement that upgrade them till 512KiB (Danish mod) or 640KiB.


I has been tested with some original warning Minerva codes from 128K QLs and also with QL with Danish mod of 512B.

Not tested yet with mods of 640K (usually this mod has an extra IC in piggybag over original RAM ICs), but should work the same

Next part of the work will face the basic program in order to give to it more functionalities, but by now it is more than enough.

This document in still under development.
